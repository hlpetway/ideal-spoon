# Redux Toolkit MaterialUI TypeScript Example

This is an example app including Product Details page including a table of product sales, a chart of sales and a left sidebar with product details. The chart is just a screenshot for now. I will go back in and add the chart component from Material UI as well.

## Commands

- Run the app with `npm run dev`
- Run the tests with `npm run test`
