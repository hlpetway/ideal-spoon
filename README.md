# Redux Toolkit MaterialUI TypeScript Example

This is an example app including Product Details page including a table of product sales, a chart of sales and a left sidebar with product details. The chart is just a screenshot for now. When I have somemore time I will go back in and add the chart component from Material UI as well.

This app is not a static page app. To allow the api call to work you will need to run this app locally. Instructions are as follows:

## Commands

- Run the app with `npm run dev`
- Run the tests with `npm run test`
